# Counter Propagation Neural Network (CPNN) implementations

Repository done for my Bachelor Thesis at FIB-UPC.

This repository includes:

*	A requirements.txt file with the necessary installs for the networks to function
*	Three implementations of the CPNN: Forward-Only, Full, and a hybrid Forward-Only + MLP
*	A simple MLP implementation to benchmark and compare the CPNNs with
